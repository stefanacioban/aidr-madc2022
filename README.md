:two: Exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics, dashboards of the raw data included)  
:three: Data preprocessing (dashboards of the preprocessed data included)  
:four: Model selection (either classification or regression problem, train test split included)  
:five: Model validation  
:six: ML pipeline for prediction  
:seven: Pipeline integration and prediction (dashboards of the predicted values included)  
:eight: Presentation of the results (pdf and power point)  

## :memo: Side notes
Some prerequisites:
* Database connection using the preferred IDE (DataSpell, PyCharm, etc.)
* Connection to dedicated visualization tools (Tableau, PowerBI)
* The code will be written in notebook files exclusively, while the dashboards will be exported to external files and attached to the final report.
